A simple IT Asset Management System (PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, jQuery/AJAX)

This simple Asset Management System can be used by the IT Dept to manage the IT Assets of an organisation.

With this system you can perform basic IT Asset Management tasks such as:
- add a new or existing IT asset/device
- assign a device to a user (staff/employee)
- mark a device as unassigned (returned by a former user)
- reassign an existing device to another user
- mark a device as faulty
- keep track of when a device was bought and its cost
- keep track of all staff who have used a particular device since it was bought.
- keep track of all devices (past and current) assigned to a particular staff/user.
- mark a device as sold out (auctioned) by the organisation.

#More Detailed explanation of how useful the system can be to the IT Dept in managing its IT Assets will follow soon...
